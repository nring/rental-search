# Rental Search

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get off the ground and developing quickly.

[Demo](https://nring.github.io/rental-search)

The majority of the functionality that was specified by the instructions is included in this app. However some fallbacks were cut in order to stay within the time constraints for the project. User input validation, graceful fallbacks for browsers that don't support Date inputs, and building a wrapper for to allow for cross-domain requests to Hotwire's API are notable exceptions. Upon submitting of the search form, local dummy data is used to populate the list.

I believe I could have used vanilla JS to create the same app functionality faster, but I wanted to challenge myself with this project. I don't have significant experience with React and I thought this was a great exercise to get more familiar with it.
